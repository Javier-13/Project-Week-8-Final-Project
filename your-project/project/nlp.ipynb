My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is \"Teachers\".

When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High.

This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half.
